   * At the time of this writing, events are uploaded and processed through Google Analytics.

   * If you wish to record something, please keep in mind the privacy of users.
   *
   * If you define a new category/action/label, please update the constants in "telemetry.h".

   * @param aCategory A general category for the event, used for sorting. Example
   *    categories: "gui_action", "voice_action", "performance", ...
   *    See the #defines for standard categories.
   * @param aAction The action undertaken by the user or the app, also used for sorting.
   *    Generally speaking, that's the verb of the sentence. Examples: "clicked".
   * @param aLabel More information about the action. Generally speaking, that's
   *    the object of the action, e.g. "button_play", "silence", "duration_ms".
   *    If there is a physical unit involved, it should appear here.
   * @param aMeasure Some value measured by the action. For instance, a duration,
   *    a memory amount, ...
